## Overview

This "Car Project" is a modern backend application developed using Java with the Spring Boot framework. It is designed with a **modular microservices architecture** [1-3], enabling scalable deployment and smooth maintenance. The project exposes **RESTful APIs** for various operations related to car listings, user management, and associated services [1, 5].

## Key Features

*   **RESTful API Development:** Implements **RESTful APIs** with proper validation, error handling, pagination, and sorting capabilities [1]. REST APIs in this project are designed to be **stateless** [6] and utilise **self-descriptive messages** using MIME types [6]. Common HTTP methods used include **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE** for interacting with resources [5, 7, 8].
*   **Authentication & Access Control:** Features **JWT-based authentication** and **role-based access control** implemented using Spring Security [1, 9]. Authentication involves validating user credentials like username, password, or a secret key to protect API endpoints [10].
*   **Database Management:** Leverages **Hibernate ORM** and **Spring Data JPA** for efficient database schema modelling and interaction [1, 11, 12]. The project primarily uses a **MySQL database connector** [13, 14]. It supports standard **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** operations such as selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting data [13-21], all performed through a dedicated Repository layer [22-24].
*   **Cloud Integration (AWS S3):** Integrates **AWS S3** for **secure and scalable storage** of files and images, including efficient upload mechanisms and access controls [4].
*   **Real-time & Asynchronous Processing:** Implements **real-time notifications** using **Twilio SMS/Email APIs** to enhance user engagement [4, 25]. **Kafka** is leveraged for **asynchronous processing** of these notifications, thereby improving system performance [4].
*   **Car Listing & Booking Systems:** Provides dedicated APIs for **managing car listings** (supporting **CRUD operations** for sellers) [4, 23, 24]. It includes a user-friendly system for **booking test drives** and managing car availability [4].
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Utilises DTOs (e.g., `AgentDto`, `AreaDto`, `CarDto`, `OTPDetails`) to take form data and convert it into specific class objects [26-30].
*   **Robust Exception Handling:** Incorporates mechanisms for handling runtime errors, including explicit mention of potential **`NullPointerException`** issues [13, 14]. Custom exceptions can be created by extending the `Exception` class [24, 26]. Exception handling is achieved using **`try-catch` blocks** [2, 31-35] and the **`@ControllerAdvice` annotation** in Spring Boot [32, 36]. The `finally` block is used for code that must always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred [16-19, 34, 37-39].
*   **OTP Generation and Validation:** Includes functionality for generating and validating One-Time Passwords (OTPs) with a defined expiration time (e.g., 5 minutes) [40].

## Technologies Used

*   **Java**: Core programming language [41].
*   **Spring Boot**: Framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications [5, 42].
*   **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorisation [1, 9].
*   **Hibernate ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping tool [1, 12, 43].
*   **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access layer development [1].
*   **MySQL**: Relational database [13, 14, 44].
*   **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management tool [43, 45, 46].
*   **Kafka**: For asynchronous messaging and real-time data pipelines [4].
*   **Twilio APIs**: For SMS and email notifications [4, 25].
*   **AWS S3**: Cloud storage service [4].
*   **Git & GitHub**: Version control and code hosting [Conversation History, 90].
*   **RESTful Web Services**: Design paradigm for APIs that communicate using HTTP methods [5, 6].

## Project Structure (Core Components)

The project follows a typical layered architecture:
*   **Entity Layer**: Defines database entities (e.g., `Car`, `User`, `Agent`, `Area`) [27, 28, 47-49].
*   **Payload Layer**: Contains DTOs for data transfer (e.g., `AgentDto`, `AreaDto`, `CarDto`, `OTPDetails`) [26-28].
*   **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and interacts with the Repository layer [22].
*   **Repository Layer**: An interface that provides methods to perform **CRUD operations** on the database [22, 24].
*   **Exception Layer**: Custom exception handling for application-specific errors [26].

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+**: The JDK provides the necessary tools for developing, compiling, and running Java applications [16-19, 50, 51].
*   **Maven**: Used for building the project and managing dependencies [43, 45, 46].
*   **MySQL Database**: A running instance of MySQL [13, 14, 44].
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd car-project
    ```
2.  **Configure Database**:
    *   Update your `application.properties` (or `application.yml` [52]) file with your MySQL database credentials (username and password) and connection details [44, 53].
3.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application typically starts from the class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` [54].

## API Usage (Examples)

The project exposes RESTful API endpoints for various operations. You can use tools like **Postman** [55, 56] to test these endpoints.

*   **User Registration**: `POST /api/users/signup` (for users like `content-manager`) [57]
*   **Car Listings Management**: `POST /api/cars`, `GET /api/cars/{id}`, `PUT /api/cars/{id}`, `DELETE /api/cars/{id}` (example endpoints for CRUD operations on car listings).
*   **OTP Operations**: Endpoints for `genrateOTP` and `validateOTP` using mobile numbers [40].
